In our daily life we often see people are facing several problems to find a **house/mess** for rent. It’s become more complex when the person is a **_bachelor_**. Because, in the context of Bangladesh huge number of **landlords has negative concept about bachelors**.  For job holders, it’s actually harder to find a house/mess as well as **time consuming**. To rent a house/mess the person must be travel physically from one place to another which is **cost-intensive also taking considerable time**.

Sometimes it’s also painful for landlords to find leaseholder in the time. Therefore, they lose the amount of money in every month.

In order to **overcome those difficulties, we are introducing a new platform where anyone can rent house/mess within a few seconds**. Where, Landlords are allowed to post about their empty house/mess.
